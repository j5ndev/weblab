# Web Lab

This project is a scratch workspace for conducting experiments with HTML, CSS and JavaScript that is loaded by a web browser.

## Exercises

New expermiments are added as a subfolder to the `exercises` folder.

Each experiment folder is prefixed with a three digit, zero padded number to perserve a logical order to exploring the experiments.

This format was inspired by the [ziglings](https://codeberg.org/ziglings/exercises) project, which in turn was inspired by the [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) project.
