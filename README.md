# Web Lab

A scratch workspace for conducting experiments with HTML, CSS and JavaScript that are loaded by a web browser.

## Exercises

New expermiments are added as a subfolder to the `exercises` folder.

Each experiment folder are prefixed with a three digit, zero padded number to perserve the order in which they were added.

This format was inspired by the [ziglings](https://codeberg.org/ziglings/exercises) project, which in turn was inspired by the [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) project.
